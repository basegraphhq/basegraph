# Comments

**Default: Don't add comments.** All contributors are senior engineers.

**When to comment:**
- Dev explicitly requests it
- Explaining *why* (not how or what) for non-obvious decisions
- TODOs / unimplemented code / future work — these stay

**When uncertain:** Ask the dev before or after the change — suggest where comments might help and why.
